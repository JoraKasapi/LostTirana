He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families of the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana, while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa shows this intent too with its big, functional balconies, the way it is developed on its ground floor in an ‘L’ shape. A special characteristic of this Villa is the fact that its volumetry is treated with organic lines and shapes instead of the straight lines and angles of most of the buildings of that period.",

        "description": "The first Cinema in Tirana, also known as Cinema-Theater ‘Nacional’ project realized by the architect Skënder Luarasi, in  1924. It represented a very important cultural center at the time and gathering place for the cities inhabitants. In 1945 took the name ’17 nëntori’ (the date of Tirana’s Independence). It was used as a cinema until 1991 (during which its ownership changed from the ‘Beshiret’ family to the Government).It was dominated by three high arches that sustained the projection cabin. The entrance was resolved with a certain simplicity and showed the professional skills of the author. The main hall was small and the black marble coverings had a certain calming effect. From there, you could walk in the ‘platea’ auditorium or go upstairs to the ‘logias’ . The main cinema hall was well proportioned and with optimal auditive and visual parameters. On the right side were the doors to the exit. There was also a summer cinema that was very well connected with that winter cinema hall. It was the most luxurious Cinema in the capital during the king's regime and during the occupation also.  Later on, some popular courts were held in its inner space and after that, it was used for spiritual sessions etc, until it decayed completely and it was given to its original owners back again, but it never returned back to being a cinema again. Finally in 2003, the decision to completely demolish it, was taken and instead of it, a 'Shopping mall'was erected. In the beginning, it was said to save and re-use the existing façade of the building but afterwards this idea wasn’t implemented. Everything from the old Cinema vanished as it apparently never existed, the only thing remaining the same was its name .",

Therefore it was labeled as an intentioned provocation to the official Communist art of the time. Also the building’s volumetri was perceived as with clear orientation towards ‘Kubism’ in a visible contrast with the gloomy socialist architecture preveling that periode. Today, eventhough it stands in one of the most visible spots of the city center, its condition provokes a state of compassion, an eyesore, where each sign of the time passing-by, is sufficiently visible from the lack of plaster in the  main facades to the illegal adjanted  spaces on the groundfloor etc. A structure that once provoked so much reaction, today stays completely ignored and neglected. Its architect is Maks Velo",

The company provided fast realization with a lower price because of the use of prefabricated elements from Milan. It was meant to be a sort of Cultural Center, with a sportive character also with a swimming pool, theater, offices, restaurant and serving as a social-meeting point for the citizens. In therms of the volumetric composition, it is organised with two main ‘factory’ type of volumes, simetric with each other through a main axe and connected through a ‘portico’. Its aesthetic, brings to mind a post-futuristic style like the one of Angiolo Mazzonit.  The materials used are  concrete, wood and some  prefabricated panels called 'populit' or ‘patercimento’. The constructive system is made of reinforced concrete very light 12x15cm height 8.5m, high enough to sustain an wooden truss as the roof structure. On the site of the National Theater which represents a public domain space, through a Public-Private agreement its intended to demolish the existing Theater and  realize a new one together with several high-rise, mixed-use buildings, project from the Danish architecture firm BIG. Currently a very contested decision from specialists of the field and local community.  ",

This project was realized in 1935 but the construction works lasted until 1936, from the Italian engenieer Giulio Berte (whome is a very important name in the history of the architecture of Tirana, the one who realized The Palace of Brigades, once ‘The Royal Villa’ and  the design of the Scanderbeg Square in Tirana). This villa was commissioned by the once mayor of the Municipality of Tirana, Abedin Nepravishta ( Mayor from 1934-1936, and 1937-1939). This project was thought to have influenced King Zogu to ask Berte to realize also the project for his residence villa, ‘Royal Villa’ very notable today because of some similirities in terms of their design. Like many other Italian architects of that time G.Berte also intended a rational style with a representative character not realated to the existing architecture of the surrounding but  providing a certain combination of modernity and identity of the context also respecting specific urban conditions towards the main streets. Being a villa situated  in a crossroad of two very important mobility axes, it’s volumetry as a result was very defined and geometric, at the same time monumental providing a view towards the ‘Mussolini’ Boulevard, ‘Ethem Bej Mosque’ and further on to the main ‘Scanderbeg Square’. It has a very clear plan organizations, with an underground plan, ground floor plan, first floor and terrace. Talking about the functional organization , its ground floor was meant to host mixed use spaces.Thre  main areas along the Boulevard Mussolini , treated like duplexes with specific staircases connecting to the first floor and  the technical  spaces underground. The other part of the ground floor plan was reserved for  an apartment  that communicated also to the inner garden. Meanwhile all the first floor has a residential use therefore represents a more intimate space. Its structural system is a compound one with  perimetral massive walls of 30-45cm and inner reinforced concrete beam-column system.From 1945 until 1992 it served as a Kindergraden  and after 1992 the original owners got it back.",

The villa was built  in 1938 from a very rich and important family of Tirana ‘Kollciu’ with the main purpose to be a house for two brothers, fact  that is  also emphasized by the symmetric plan organization of the villa. Later on it was seized under the order of King Zog and it served as the base for ‘Radio Tirana’ until 1965. After that its inner space was used by The Institute of Anthroplogy and Art studies, which later on moved also from there since its private owners appeared again and today It stands in very bad conditions. The villa is composed by four floors and one of them stands underground .It has two main entrances and one of them is directed towards the backyard. It has a very harmonic, neoclassical façade with columns without orders, prefabricated granil (granulated stones composition) staircase, a main hallway with marble tiles, windows with wooden frames, metallic balustrades. Currently there are some people from the ‘rome’ community living in the building. It is believed that the actual owner of the Villa led them ‘squat’ and clean the inner space before taking back the villa and reconstruct it for its main interest. It is believed. Everything regarding the fate of the villa is a speculation, some of the inhabitants around the neighbourhood say the actual owner wants to recreate a Museum out of it but none of this regarding its fate is yet confirmed .

In  1988 the building  became functional  and worked as such until 1992 with the capitulation of the Communist regime. Afterwards  the building went through several changes regarding its function. It was used as Conference hall, later as an humanitarian center around 1999 with the placement of the NATO headquarter in Kosovo. In 2001 Top Chanel headquarters was positioned there, making possible for it to be used  at the same time as a space for a nightclubs or gathering political space the part of the courtyard.

        "description": " The idea of the plan to realize ‘Kombinati Tekstil Stalin’ came up in the second meeting of the Congress of  PPSH (Albanian Labour Party) where it was decided that Albania would develop as an agrocultural and industrial country. The plan had a clear view of organizing the industrial areas in the  closer suburbs, so that it wont be a big distance from the city center, so that they could have under control the cost for proper transportations. Their location in the suburbs areas, was meant in case of further expansion of these areas. ‘Kombinati tekstil Stalin’ was built with the help (economical and expertise) of the Soviet Union, it occupied an area of 25ha at the ‘Yzberisht’ valley, around 5km away from the city center. Albania was under a totalitarian regime and the concept of the city back then, was that of a ‘static’ one with separated  areas with specific functions each, therefor the intent was to create a small city in kombinat with a the working area, residential area (for workers), recreational area so that they wouldn’t need to move to the city center, but all their live would be organised in that micro-city. It was built around 1948 and the production started around 1951. During that time, it was one of the biggest industrial areas in Albania. The number of the  the people employed there  until 1953 was 2200 and the intent was to encrease that number to 4500, by 1955. Kombinati had also its own powerhouse.",
