He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families in the city., being also once the mayor of Tirana. While he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa shows this intent too with this big , functional balconies, the way it is developed on its ground floor in an  ‘L’ shape. A special characteristic of this Villa is the fact that its volumetry is treated with organic lines and shapes instead of the straight lines and angles of most of the buildings of that period."

It was used as a cinema until 1991 (during which its ownership changed from the ‘Beshiret’ family to the Government). Later on , some popular courts were held in its inner space and after that  it was used for spiritual sessions etc until it decayed completely and it was given to its original owners back again , but it never  returned back to being a cinema again.  Finally in 2003 , the decision to completely demolish it , was taken and instead of it building  erecting a Shopping mall. In the beginning , it was said to save and re-use the existing façade of the building  but afterwards this idea wasn’t implemented. Everything from the old Cinema vanished as it apparently never existed , the only thing remaining the same was its name ."

Later on it was seized under the order of King Zog and it served as the base for ‘Radio Tirana’ until 1965.  After that its inner space was used by The Institute of Anthroplogy and Art studies, which later on moved also from there since its private owners appeared again and today It stands in very bad conditions. The villa is composed by four floors and one of them stands underground .It has two main entrances and one of them is directed towards the backyard. It has a very harmonic, neoclassical façade with columns without orders, prefabricated granil (granulated stones composition) staircase, a main hallway with marble tiles, windows with wooden frames, metallic balustrades. Currently there are some people from the ‘rome’ community living in the building. It is believed that the actual owner of the Villa led them ‘squat’ and clean the inner space before taking back the villa and reconstruct it for its main interest. It is believed .Everything regarding the fate of the villa is a speculation , some of the inhabitants around the neighbourhood say the actual owner wants to recreate a Museum out of it but none of this regarding its fate is yet confirmed .
